    <h3>Differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
        HTML and CSS are a pair that make up every website we see today, they work together to form great websites that are visually appealing.
    </p>

    <p>HTML is the content that we see on a webpage, HTML makes up all of the words on a page, it also includes things such as tables and forms that you may interact with on a website.</p>

    <p>CSS is a fun language that can be described as the paint brushes of web development, all of the styling, colours, fonts and many more things that we see on web pages are due to CSS.</p>

    <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <p>
        Control flow is a terminology in computer programming that is the order in which functions, statements ect are executed.
    </p>

    <h3>Loops</h3>
    <p>
        Loops are used when you want to run code several times over, the most common way to create a loop is using the <span class="highlight">for</span> statement, however there are several other loop statements that can be used, they can be seen below.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="lists"><span class="highlight">for/in</span> - loops through the properties of an object</li>
        <li class="lists"><span class="highlight">for/of</span> - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
        <li class="lists"><span class="highlight">while</span> - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
        <li class="lists"><span class="highlight">do/while</span> - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Dom</h3>
    <p>
        The Dom, short for Document Object Model is a useful tool that all the major web browsers have built into them, it allows us, the user, to interact with web pages and make changes on our local version, if you want to interact with the DOM follow these steps below.
    </p>

    <h4>How to interact with the DOM</h4>

    <ol>
        <li class="lists">Right Click on the Web page you wish to use the DOM on</li>
        <li class="lists">Click <span class="highlight">Inspect</span></li>
        <li class="lists">Happy exploring!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays</h3>
    <p>
        In Javascript Arrays are a way of storing data, in this example we have stored a name's, gender & age.
    </p>
    <img id="arrayExplanation" src="images/arrayExplanation.png">

    <p>Accessing data from an array is fairly straightforward, to access data from an array we use an index.</p>

    <h3>Accessing Data from Objects</h3>
    <p>
        Objects are slightly similar to Arrays however they are formatted differently, below is an example of the same data in the array above formatted into how an object operates.
    </p>
    <img id="objectExample" src="images/objectExample.png">

    <p>The easiest way to access information from an array is to use a <span class="highlight">dot</span> notion.</p>
