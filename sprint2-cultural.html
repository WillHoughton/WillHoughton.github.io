    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
            My goal is to work my way into a web development job, in the long term I want to become a full stack developer and be able to cover all of the main programming languages.
    </p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
    <p>
            While at EDA I would like to improve my communication skills in both a team environment and working online with others.
    </p>

    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>
            My strengths are that I am very reliable and am also focused on what I want to achieve.
            My weaknesses are that I can procrastinate on tasks that I am disinterested in.
            
    </p>

    <h3>a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>
    <p>
            At the moment I work 30 hours a week at a restaurant, this takes up time from 3 pm onwards, I work around this by doing course work in the mornings from 9 am - 2 pm.

    </p>

    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
    <p>
            I will seek help from course facilitators through slack.
    </p>

    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
            I expect the facilitation team to let me know about changes in course work and also help with course work when Iâ€™m struggling.
    </p>

    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
    <p class="bottomPart">I am usually at work from late afternoon til late and will be unable to commit to course work then.</p>
